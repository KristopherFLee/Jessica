    <p>I am ,ready for love<br> 
        Why are you hiding from me<br>
        I'd quickly give my freedom<br>
        To be held in your captivity<br>
        I am ready for love<br>
        All of the joy and the pain<br>
        And all the time that it takes<br>
        Just to stay in your good grace<br>
        Lately I've been thinking<br>
        Maybe you're not ready for me<br>
        Maybe you think I need to learn maturity<br>
        They say watch what you ask for<br>
        Cause you might receive<br>
        But if you ask me tomorrow<br>
        I'll say the same thing<br>
        I am ready for love<br>
        Would you please lend me your ear?<br>
        I promise I won't complain<br>
        I just need you to acknowledge I am here<br>
        If you give me half a chance<br>
        I'll prove this to you<br>
        I will be patient, kind, faithful and true<br>
        To a man who loves music<br>
        A man who loves art<br>
        Respect's the spirit world<br>
        And thinks with his heart<br>
        I am ready for love<br>
        If you'll take me in your hands<br>
        I will learn what you teach<br>
        And do the best that I can<br>
        I am ready for love<br>
        Here with an offering of<br>
        My voice<br>
        My Eyes<br>
        My soul<br>
        My mind<br>
        Tell me what is enough<br>
        To prove I am ready for love</p>
</body>
